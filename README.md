# Social-Crime-Analytics-Using-Linear-Regression-and-Name-Entity-Recognition  
This project applies **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to analyze crime data, focusing on **IPC 302 (Homicide) cases in India**. The goal is to uncover patterns in crime records, predict police deployment needs, and provide actionable insights for law enforcement and policy-making.  
## 🔍 Key Features  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and handled missing values from ~40,000 crime records.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Trends across cities, crime domains, and victim demographics.  
- **Linear Regression:** Predicted police deployment based on victim age, evaluated using R² Score and MSE.  
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER):** Extracted entities like weapons and crime descriptors from text.  
- **Visualization:** Scatter plots, regression lines, and NER outputs for better interpretability.  
## 📊 Technologies Used  
- **Programming:** Python  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, SpaCy  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Dataset:** Crime dataset with city, victim details, crime type, weapon used, and police deployment  
## 🚀 Outcomes  
- Demonstrated ML performance on real-world crime data.  
- Gained insights into homicide patterns and resource allocation.  
- Integrated regression and NLP for enhanced crime analytics.  
## 📌 Future Scope  
- Extend analysis to other **IPC crime codes**.  
- Apply **advanced ML models** (Random Forest, XGBoost) for improved accuracy.  
- Deploy a **web-based dashboard** for real-time monitoring and visualization.
